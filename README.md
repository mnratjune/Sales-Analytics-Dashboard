**Conclusion**üåü

The analysis reveals key insights into customer demographics and product sales trends from 2020 to 2022. The majority of customers are middle-aged women, predominantly married, holding professional roles, and earning moderate salaries. This demographic is likely influenced by a stable lifestyle, reflected in the high rate of home ownership and education levels.

In terms of sales performance:

Accessories emerged as the most popular product category, especially Tires and Tubes, suggesting high customer demand for supplementary biking gear.
Road Bikes led sales within the bike category, underscoring a specific interest in biking that could be further targeted.
Jerseys were the top-selling item within clothing, indicating that functional biking apparel is favored.
An anomaly observed was the absence of sales for Components throughout the three-year period, which could indicate a lack of interest or gaps in inventory availability for this category. Addressing this gap may reveal new opportunities for sales growth.

**Recommendations**üöÄ

Targeted Marketing: Tailor marketing campaigns to appeal to middle-aged, professional women by highlighting the practical benefits of accessories and biking gear.
Expand Inventory: Consider adding more options within the Components category and promoting these items to meet potential hidden demand.
Product Line Expansion: Given the popularity of Tires, Tubes, and Jerseys, consider expanding these lines to include more options for style and functionality.
This analysis supports a strategy focused on enhancing the product offerings that align with current customer interests and exploring new avenues for growth in underrepresented categories.
